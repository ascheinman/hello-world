I'm chaning this to reflect who I am and experiment the git hub platoform. 
I like pina colads, but hate getting caught in the rain. 
Monospace type is bae. If you understand what that means you could be bae. 
Bacon always has/is bae. 

##Experimenting with  **Markdown**
Lets write more things... Yay for no taking hands off the keyboard!!!
_So much more productive!!!!!_

###Experimenting with code markup
````C
  int i = 2;
  fprintf ( stderr, "Hello World! \n let's write some code");
  if ( apple == orange )
  {
    i++;
  }
  return i;
````
````python
def authenticate( aSession, username, password):
    aSession.post(_url('j_spring_security_check'), params = {'j_username':username, 'j_password':password} )
    
  `````
  regular stuff
